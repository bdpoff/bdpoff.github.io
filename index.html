			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Greetings! I'm a recent college graduate who studied Psychology and Computer Science to learn more about how
				people and computers work, respectively. While the knowledge I gained was fulfilling, I have found my
				problem-solving experience in both fields to be the most useful. Whether it's designing an experiment to
				measure human behavior or rooting through code to find a troublesome bug, I relish these sorts of challenges.
				That's why I keep busy with various technical projects--to generate a product while solving the problems I
				encounter, and to keep my skills sharp! On this site you'll find synopses of these endeavors, as well as
				some more information about me. If you have any questions regarding anything you see, please let me know.
