		    	<p>
		        	Most of my undergraduate coursework was completed in Java-based environments. From my very first 
				"Introduction to Programming" class to the aptly named "Software Practice", I learned how to use Java to 
				build progressively more complex programs. I've kept up with these skills since graduation by working on 
				developing my own Android app called Countervail.

		    	<h3>Video Editing</h3>
			<p>
				For several years I've used Adobe After Effects to produce video content that is monetized by Google. I'm
				still an amateur, but each time I edit footage, I learn something new. You can see a few title sequences I 
				whipped up, and judge their merits for yourself!
